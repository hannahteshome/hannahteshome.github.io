        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Hannah Teshome, and I am currently a second-year undergraduate student at the University of California, Riverside, where I am pursuing a degree in Psychology. Originally from Sacramento, California, I moved to Riverside to start my academic journey. I have always been fascinated by the complexities of human behavior and the mind, especially growing up with a parent who struggles with mental illness. This curiosity led me to choose psychology as my major. 
<br><br>

       Throughout my time at UC Riverside, I have been fortunate to gain hands-on experience working at the university’s Student Disability Resource Center (SDRC). In this role, I have had the privilege of assisting students who have diverse learning and physical needs, ensuring they receive the proper accommodations to succeed in their academic endeavors. This experience has been incredibly rewarding, as it has allowed me to understand the challenges faced by individuals with disabilities and to contribute to their academic success in a meaningful way. Working at the SDRC has also helped me develop essential skills in communication, problem-solving, and empathy—skills that are crucial in the field of psychology. As I continue my undergraduate studies, I am actively seeking ways to further enhance my resume and career prospects in psychology. I am eager to explore additional opportunities, such as internships, volunteer work, or research positions, that will deepen my understanding of the field and provide more direct exposure to the work of licensed psychologists. Networking with professionals in psychology and attending related events will also help me build connections and stay informed about emerging trends and advancements in the field.
<br><br>

       After I complete my bachelor’s degree in psychology, my goal is to further my education by pursuing a Ph.D. in Counseling Psychology. The decision to specialize in counseling psychology was motivated by my passion for helping individuals navigate through difficult life experiences, emotional struggles, and mental health issues. I believe that counseling psychologists play a critical role in providing therapeutic support to individuals, helping them heal, and developing coping strategies to lead healthier and more fulfilling lives. My ultimate dream is to work as a clinical psychologist, where I can directly assist individuals in managing their mental health and emotional well-being. I am particularly interested in focusing on therapy for adolescents and young adults, as I feel that these age groups face unique challenges that can significantly impact their personal and academic growth. In addition to my clinical aspirations, I am also passionate about contributing to the research side of psychology. I hope to engage in research projects that explore effective therapeutic techniques, mental health disparities, and the various factors that influence an individual’s psychological well-being. By combining both clinical practice and research, I aim to make a well-rounded impact in the field of psychology, improving the lives of those struggling with mental health issues while contributing to the overall understanding of human behavior. Ultimately, my journey to becoming a psychologist is driven by a deep desire to make a positive difference in the lives of others. I am committed to continuing my education, gaining experience, and refining my skills to achieve my dream of becoming a licensed clinical psychologist who can help individuals navigate their emotional struggles and lead healthier, more fulfilling lives.
